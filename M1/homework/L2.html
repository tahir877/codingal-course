        The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical
        rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin
        encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by
        the rainforest.[3] This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous
        territories.
