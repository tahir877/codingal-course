                <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>

                <p>
                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
                    attributes Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same 
                    number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around
                    42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans,
                    dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs
                    perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
                    companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

                    Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body
                    posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents,
                    pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely 
                    when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to humabehavior;
                    this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans.
                    As such, the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs'
                    influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
